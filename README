JSARToolkit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a JavaScript port of FLARToolKit, operating on canvas images and
video element contents. And hopefully one day on device elements with webcam
input.

The license is GPL 3 as was the original library.

All the hard work was done by the ARToolKit/NyARToolKit/FLARToolKit people,
a huge thank you to them. This port was quite mechanical, though it has some
major JS optimizations and a tracking robustness hack or two. And some
uninformed bogus hacks in FLARParam to sort-of make it work on 16:9 video.

See demos/AR_simple_webgl.html for an example of integrating JSARToolKit
output with a WebGL program.

I've only tested the ID markers and square detection paths, so you may
encounter problems working with custom markers. In which case, filing a bug
report on GitHub would be very much appreciated.
